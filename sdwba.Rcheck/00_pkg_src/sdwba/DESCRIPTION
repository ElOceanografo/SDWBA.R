Description: This package is used to calculate the acoustic backscattering coefficients and target strengths of fluid-like objects or animals with distorted cylindrical shapes. The stochastic distorted-wave Born approximation (SDWBA) is a relatively simple and accurate method for predicting the acoustic cross-section, and is useful for a variety of zooplankton and fish without swimbladders.
